"""Selection algorithms for rationales shown during question review.

Each algorithm is a callable taking these arguments:

  rng: The random number generator to use.

  first_answer_choice: The first choice of the student.

  entered_rationale: The rationale text entered by the student.

  question: The Question instance for the current question.

The callable must return a list of tuples (choice_index, choice_label,
rationales), where rationales is a list of pairs
(rationale_id, rationale_text).

The callable must have the following attributes:

  version: A version string for the algorithm.

  verbose_name: A human-readable short name for use in the admin interface.

  description: A long description explaining how the
  algorithm chooses rationales.

To make an algorithm available to users, make sure to add it to
the "algorithms" dictionary at the end of this file.
